It has a palindromic order of words or phrases (AB:BA). The used words are often opposite in meaning. This device helps to lay stress on the second part of the sentence, due to the sudden change of the structure.<\/p>\r\n<p>examples:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>It is <strong>strange<\/strong> - but<strong> true,<\/strong> for<strong> truth<\/strong> is always<strong> strange<\/strong>.<\/li>\r\n<li>Never let a <strong>Fool Kiss You<\/strong>, or a<strong> Kiss Fool You<\/strong>.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>"}
