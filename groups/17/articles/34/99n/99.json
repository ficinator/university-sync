This method adds balance to sentences giving ideas a smoother flow and thus can be persuasive because of the repetition it employs.<\/p>\r\n<p>example:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\u0160tefan ran<strong> into<\/strong> the room,<strong> into<\/strong> the garden and <strong>into<\/strong> our hearts.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Like<\/strong> father,<strong> like<\/strong> son.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Easy <\/strong>come, <strong>easy <\/strong>go.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>"}
