We divide English words to three main layers: the literary layer, the neutral layer, the colloquial layer.<\/p>\r\n<p>1. <strong>The Literary Layer<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong><em>terms<\/em><\/strong> - words or word groups used to name a notion characteristic of some special field. Terms are mostly associated with scientific and technical styles (tumor, apendix)<\/li>\r\n<li><strong><em>poetic and highly literary words<\/em><\/strong> - words contrasting with all other words because they have been traditionally used in poetry (<em>slay - <\/em>kill, <em>hapless <\/em>- unhappy)<\/li>\r\n<li><strong><em>obsolescent words <\/em><\/strong>- (archaism) rarely used old words (<em>garniture <\/em>- furniture, <em>palfrey <\/em>- small horese)<\/li>\r\n<li><em><strong>obsolete words<\/strong> -\u00a0 <\/em>(archaism) words that are not used anymore but are recognized by native speakers (<em>damsel <\/em>- young lady, <em>eve <\/em>- evening)<\/li>\r\n<li><strong><em>historisms<\/em><\/strong>- words describing things that are no longer used (<em>baldric <\/em>- belt for a sword,\u00a0<em>blazon <\/em>- coat of arms)<\/li>\r\n<li><strong><em>archaisms<\/em><\/strong>- when a word is no longer in general use but not completely unused (<em>troth <\/em>- faith)<\/li>\r\n<li><strong><em>barbarisms<\/em><\/strong>-foreign words that have not been entirely assimilated into the English language (<em>ad infinitum <strong>-<\/strong><\/em> to infinity, <em>en passant <\/em>- in passing)<\/li>\r\n<li><em><strong>foreignisms<\/strong> <\/em>- foreign words used for stylistic purposes. They are not in the English vocabulary and are often italicized (The French say that wine has \"<em>de la robe du bouquet, dela cuise\"<\/em>)<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>2. <strong>The Neutral Layer - Standard English Vocabulary<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 The neutral layer means official language taught at schools and universities. It is that form of English which is current and literary and is recognized as acceptable wherever English is spoken or understood. Neutral words do not have any stylistic colouring (n. <em>child - <\/em>lit. <em>infant <\/em>- col. <em>kid<\/em>) (n. <em>continue <\/em>- lit. <em>proceed <\/em>- col. <em>go on<\/em>)<\/p>\r\n<p>3. <strong>The Colloquial Layer<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 It is the vocabulary that people actually use under various circumstances.<\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>literary colloquial <\/strong>- vocabulary used by educated people in conversation<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>familiar colloquial <\/strong>- vocabulary used by the younger generation whose speech is more free and careless.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>low colloquial <\/strong>- vocabulary of the illiterate popular speech<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 Special colloquial vocabulary includes:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong><em>slang<\/em> <\/strong>- the special vocabulary used by any set of persons of a low or disreputable character (<em>undergrad <\/em>- undergraduate student, <em>fresher <\/em>- first year student, <em>randomer<\/em> - someone unknown to you)<\/li>\r\n<li><em><strong>jargon<\/strong> <\/em>- is used by high-status groups and is often associated with professional terminology e.g. computer jargon, legal jargon etc. (<em>macro-environment, sub-segments, give air support<\/em>)<\/li>\r\n<li><strong><em>professionalisms <\/em><\/strong>- words used in a certain profession by people connected by common interests at work (<em>tin fish - <\/em>submarine, <em>beans <\/em>- small coals, in mining)<\/li>\r\n<li><em><strong>dialectal words<\/strong> <\/em>- words or phrases used by people who speak differently depending on where they are from (<em>to get a cob on <\/em>- get into a bad mood, <em>kecks <\/em>- trousers,\u00a0<em>meg <\/em>- half penny)<\/li>\r\n<li><strong><em>vulgarisms<\/em><\/strong> - swear words of an abusive character (<em>damn, bloody hell) <\/em><\/li>\r\n<li><strong><em>an euphemism<\/em><\/strong>- expressions refering to the taboo topics in an indirect way (<em>tired and emotional <\/em>- drunk, <em>spend a penny <\/em>- urinate)<\/li>\r\n<li><em><strong>nonce words<\/strong><\/em>- new meanings of existing words. Often spontaneous.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>4. <strong>Emotionally coloured and emotionally neutral vocabulary<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>When we speak we often express our emotional reactions. We try to express our approval or disapproval with the matter. In emotive speech we express emotions. The emotional colouring of a word may be permanent or occasional. The emotional quality of expressions is based upon associations with such notions as \"love\" or \"hate\".<\/p>\r\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 We also use affixes and special groups of emotional words to make words eotionally coloured:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong><em>diminutive affix<\/em><\/strong>- <em>daddy, darling, duckling, oldie<\/em><\/li>\r\n<li><strong><em>derogatory affix<\/em><\/strong> <em>- weakling, drunkard, dullard<\/em><\/li>\r\n<li><strong><em>intensifiers<\/em><\/strong>- special group of emotional word. These words add special intensity to what has been said indicating special importance (<em>ever, even all, so, very)<\/em><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>"}
